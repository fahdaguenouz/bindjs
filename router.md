You're looking at a **custom client-side router** — it's like how **React Router** or **Vue Router** works, but manually built using vanilla JavaScript.

Let’s explain what this file does **line by line**, in **simple terms**, and then compare it to how this works in real frameworks like React/Vue.

---

## 🔍 What Is This File?

✅ It's a **custom SPA router** (Single Page Application router).
✅ It **manages routes**, **URL changes**, and **what content to render** based on the URL.
✅ It’s **part of your mini-framework**, not totally separate.

## 📦 What It Does (Plain English Summary)

| Feature             | What it means                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `AddRoute()`        | Register a new route with its associated component |
| `go()`              | Navigate to a route programmatically               |
| `routeLookup()`     | Find which component should render for a path      |
| `window.onpopstate` | Handle back/forward browser navigation             |
| `GetParams()`       | Extract dynamic route parameters (`:id`)           |
| `routesByLevel[]`   | A layered route definition by URL segments         |

---

## 📘 Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. `window.onpopstate` & `DOMContentLoaded`

```js
window.onpopstate = () => { go(location.pathname); };
window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  go(location.pathname);
});
```

💡 This makes sure your app reacts when:

* You press the browser back/forward buttons
* The page first loads

---

### 2. `trimSlash(str)`

```js
// Removes slashes from start/end of a path
trimSlash("/users/") → "users"
```

---

### 3. `routesByLevel = []`

```js
// A 2D structure like:
// routesByLevel[0] = {
//   "users": { page: ..., params: {}, layer: "app" }
// }
// routesByLevel[1] = {
//   "users/*": { page: ..., params: { id: 1 }, layer: "app" }
// }
```

📌 This structure stores routes based on how deep the URL is (`/users/123` = depth 2).

---

### 4. `AddRoute(route, page, layer)`

```js
AddRoute("/users/:id", UserPage);
```

💡 This function registers the route. It:

* Supports dynamic segments like `:id`
* Builds a structure that can later be matched with incoming URLs

🧠 This is like calling:

```jsx
<Route path="/users/:id" element={<UserPage />} />
```

in React Router.

---

### 5. `routeLookup(route)`

```js
routeLookup("/users/123")
```

💡 This checks the route tree and finds which page/component should be displayed.

Returns:

```js
{
  found: true,
  page: () => HTMLElement,
  layer: "app",
  params: { id: 1 }
}
```

---

### 6. `go(route)`

```js
go("/users/5");
```

💡 This:

* Updates browser history using `pushState`
* Clears and replaces content in the matching `layer` (usually a `div#app`)
* Renders the component for the route

---

### 7. `GetParams()`

```js
const { id } = GetParams(); // from /users/:id
```

💡 Pulls dynamic route values from the URL. If your route was `/users/:id`, this gives you `{ id: "5" }`.

---

### 8. `back()` and `replacePath(path)`

* `back()` navigates back in history (or to `/` if nothing before).
* `replacePath(path)` updates the URL without adding a new history entry.

---

## 🧪 Full Example

### Register Route

```js
AddRoute("/users/:id", () => {
  const { id } = GetParams();
  return div({ textContent: `User ID is ${id}` });
});
```

### Navigate

```js
go("/users/42");
```

✅ Output: `<div>User ID is 42</div>`

## 📦 Is This Like React or Vue?

Yes! Just simplified and manual.

| Feature      | Your Code                     | React Router Equivalent                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Define route | `AddRoute("/users/:id", ...)` | `<Route path="/users/:id" element={...} />` |
| Navigate     | `go("/users/3")`              | `navigate("/users/3")`                      |
| Read params  | `GetParams()`                 | `useParams()`                               |
| On load/back | `window.onpopstate`           | React Router handles internally             |

---

## ✅ Summary

This router:

* **Mimics client-side routing like in frameworks**
* Lets you build **SPA navigation** (no full page reload)
* Keeps your app **modular and clean**
* Is connected to your framework (not separate)

---

## 🔧 Optional Improvements

* Add `NotFound` fallback if no match.
* Add support for `beforeEnter` or `guards`.
* Lazy load pages (`import()`).
* Animation between routes.
